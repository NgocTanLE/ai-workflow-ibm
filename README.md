# **Classifying movie reviews: a binary classification example**
Two-class classification, or binary classification, may be the most widely applied kind of machine-learning problem. In this example, you’ll learn to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, based on the text content of the reviews.

# Data Setttings
IMDB dataset: a set of 50,000 highly polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database. They’re split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing, each set consisting of 50% negative and 50% positive reviews.

# Approach
## Baseline

Traditional Techniques: Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron <br/>

In this section, we use unittest to verify the accuracy and confusion matrix of method "Logistic Regression".

# Deep Neural Network: Convolutional Neural Network


# Conclusion
In this project, as you see, we did:

How to explore extensions to a baseline model to improve training and predicting capacity.

How to use unit tests for the API and the model

How to use unit tests for logging

Can all of the unit tests be run with a single script and do all of the unit tests pass?

How to monitor performance

How to compare multiple models

How to use visualizations for the EDA investigation
